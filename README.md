# AutoClip

This project is a Python-based system designed to automate the retrieval, processing, and uploading of Twitch clips. The script downloads Twitch clips using API requests, applies video transformations, and uploads the final processed video to TikTok. The system handles user authentication, video processing, and automated API interactions.

# Functionality Overview

Users input multiple Twitch clip URLs to process.

The script extracts clip IDs and retrieves metadata via the Twitch API.

OAuth authentication is performed to access Twitch API endpoints.

# Video Processing

The clip is downloaded and saved as an MP4 file.

A blurred background version of the clip is created.

The script overlays the original clip onto the blurred background.

The final processed video is saved as an MP4 file.

# TikTok Upload

OAuth authentication is performed for TikTok API access.

The script refreshes the access token to ensure valid credentials.

The processed video is uploaded to TikTok.

API response is logged to verify successful upload.

# API Integrations

Twitch API: Retrieves clip metadata and download URLs.

TikTok API: Manages authentication and video uploads.

# Libraries Used

requests: Handles HTTP requests for API calls.

moviepy: Processes video files, applies transformations.

cv2 (OpenCV): Performs video frame blurring.

urllib.request: Downloads video files from URLs.

os: Manages file operations (creation, deletion).

# Security Considerations

API keys and secrets are stored as plain text in the script (should be secured).

OAuth tokens are refreshed automatically for uninterrupted access.

Local video files are deleted after processing to free storage.

# Future Enhancements

Cloud Storage: Store processed videos in cloud storage instead of local deletion.

GUI Implementation: Develop a simple UI for easier clip submission.

Multi-Platform Uploads: Expand to YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.

Error Handling: Implement better exception handling for failed API requests.

Config File Usage: Secure API credentials via environment variables or config files.
